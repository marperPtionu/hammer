If you are a fan of Call of Duty: Black Ops, you might want to tweak some of the game settings to suit your preferences. However, the game does not have a built-in console or a user-friendly interface for changing the configuration options. That's where Black Ops Config Editor comes in handy.
 
Black Ops Config Editor is a tool that lets you edit the config file for Black Ops multiplayer and single player modes. The config file is a text file that contains various commands and variables that control the game behavior. By using Black Ops Config Editor, you can easily modify the config file without having to manually open it with a text editor.

## How to Use Black Ops Config Editor to Customize Your Game Settings (Continued)
 
In this section, we will go over some of the most common and useful commands and variables that you can change with Black Ops Config Editor. These are not all the available options, but they cover some of the most popular ones. You can find more information about the config commands and how they work in this guide:
 
### Field of View (FOV)
 
Field of view is the angle of your vision in the game. The default FOV in Black Ops is 65, which means you can see 65 degrees horizontally. However, some players might prefer a higher or lower FOV depending on their screen size, resolution, and personal preference. A higher FOV gives you a wider view of your surroundings, but it can also cause some distortion and fisheye effect. A lower FOV gives you a narrower view, but it can also make you feel more immersed and focused.
 
To change your FOV, you can use the command cg\_fov. The value can range from 1 to 160, but most players recommend a value between 80 and 120. For example, to set your FOV to 90, you can use this command:
 `cg_fov 90` 
You can also use the command cg\_fovScale to adjust your FOV proportionally to your aspect ratio. The value can range from 0.1 to 2.0, but most players recommend a value between 0.8 and 1.2. For example, to set your FOV scale to 1.0, you can use this command:
 `cg_fovScale 1.0` 
### Motion Blur
 
Motion blur is an effect that simulates the blurring of moving objects in real life. Some players might like this effect for realism and cinematic feel, but others might find it distracting and annoying. Motion blur can also affect your performance and frame rate.
 
To enable or disable motion blur, you can use the command r\_motionblur\_enable. The value can be either 0 or 1, where 0 means off and 1 means on. For example, to turn off motion blur, you can use this command:
 `r_motionblur_enable 0` 
You can also use the command r\_motionblur\_strength to adjust the intensity of the motion blur effect. The value can range from 0 to 1, where 0 means no blur and 1 means maximum blur. For example, to set the motion blur strength to 0.5, you can use this command:
 `r_motionblur_strength 0.5` 
### Mouse Sensitivity and Acceleration
 
Mouse sensitivity and acceleration are two factors that affect how your mouse movement translates to your aim in the game. Mouse sensitivity is how fast your cursor moves on the screen when you move your mouse. Mouse acceleration is how much your cursor speed increases or decreases depending on how fast you move your mouse.
 
To change your mouse sensitivity, you can use the command sensitivity. The value can be any number, but most players recommend a value between 1 and 5. For example, to set your sensitivity to 3, you can use this command:
 `sensitivity 3` 
To enable or disable mouse acceleration, you can use the command cl\_mouseAccel. The value can be either 0 or 1, where 0 means off and 1 means on. For example, to turn off mouse acceleration, you can use this command:
 `cl_mouseAccel 0` 
You can also use the command cl\_mouseAccelOffset to adjust the threshold of mouse acceleration. The value can be any number, but most players recommend a value between 0 and 10. For example, to set the mouse acceleration offset to 5, you can use this command:
 `cl_mouseAccelOffset 5` 8cf37b1e13
